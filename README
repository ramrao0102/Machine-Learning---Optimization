This repository contains math optimization examples and code written in python

Optima for several functions are being developed here.

1) Random and Grid Sarch to find optima in 1-D and 2-D function spaces

2) Brent Optimization from scipy for simple convex and non convex univariate functions

3) Nelder Meade for non differentiable functions, including the Ackley function

4) BFGS - Broyden, Fletcher, Goldfarb, and Shanno Algorithm Implementation for Local Search Optimization

5) Least Square - Curve Fitting with Scipy

6) Stochastic Hill Climbing

7) Iterated Local Search

8) Genetic Algorithm

9) Simulated Annealing
